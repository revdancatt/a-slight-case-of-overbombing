## About

This project was inspired by monochromatic art of the late 60s, Russian folk-art woodblock prints, and the stylised colours of British underground comics. The idea was that have the landscapes of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland represented by red, yellow, green and blue.

I also had in mind that the landscapes were actually from some post apocalyptic event, the red from being covered in the weeds from War of the Worlds, or 1,000 years into the future with radioactive glow tinting the sky red, orange or yellow. The sun still rising and setting on a lifeless planet.

This lead to the name "A Slight Case of Overbombing", which is also the title of an Album by the Sister of Mercy which also features strong primary colours on the front.

This artwork is the first in a trilogy, the other two being (as of yet unreleased); "Vision Thing" and "Some Girls Wander by Mistake".

There were also a number of other palettes in addition to the red, yellow, green and blue, which the collector can cycle around. Each primary colour has access to these other palettes, but not to each other, i.e. a red artwork can't be cycled to red, gree or blue and so on.
